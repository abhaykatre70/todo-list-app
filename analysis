=====================================

Team Members:
1. Abhay Katre - Frontend Developer & Project Manager
2. Keshav - UI/UX Designer & Backend Developer

Project Objective:
Build a professional To-Do List Web Application demonstrating proper
Git workflow with clearly defined roles and separate branch management.

=====================================
1. Roles and Responsibilities
=====================================

Abhay Katre (Frontend Branch):
- HTML structure and semantic improvements
- Mobile responsive design (768px, 600px, 400px breakpoints)
- Font size and readability enhancements
- Input section and form improvements
- Integration of UI/UX designs into HTML
- Project coordination and documentation

Keshav (UI-UX Branch + Backend Branch):

UI-UX Branch:
- Design mockups (provided in PDF format)
- CSS styling implementation based on designs
- Color schemes and visual themes
- Animations, transitions, micro-interactions
- User experience improvements
- Accessibility in design

Backend Branch:
- JavaScript logic and functionality
- localStorage implementation
- Filter and sorting algorithms
- Task CRUD operations
- Date handling and validation
- Input sanitization and security

=====================================
2. Version 2 Goals
=====================================

✅ Clean branch structure (frontend, ui-ux, backend, testing, main)
✅ UI/UX designs from PDF document
✅ Proper commit message format (feat:/fix:/style:/docs:)
✅ Pull Request workflow for all changes
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ Improved font sizes (16-17px base)
✅ Local storage for data persistence
✅ Enhanced UI with smooth animations
✅ Proper documentation

=====================================
3. Problems in Version 1
=====================================

❌ Too many branches (6+ feature branches)
❌ Branches deleted before merging
❌ Direct commits to main branch
❌ Inconsistent branch naming
❌ Analysis file added late
❌ No clear role separation
❌ UI and backend mixed
❌ Poor mobile responsiveness
❌ Small font sizes

=====================================
4. Solutions in Version 2
=====================================

✅ Only 4 branches: frontend, ui-ux, backend, testing
✅ No-delete policy for role branches
✅ All changes via Pull Requests
✅ Standardized commit format: type: description
✅ Analysis file from start
✅ Clear separation: Frontend/UI/Backend
✅ Design doc (PDF) guides UI work
✅ Mobile-first approach
✅ Larger readable fonts
✅ Accessibility improvements

=====================================
5. Git Workflow Model
=====================================

           main (protected)
             |
    +--------+--------+
    |        |        |
frontend   ui-ux   backend

    +---PR---+---PR---+
             |
          testing
       (Both review)
             |
             v
           main
      (after approval)

Design Flow:
PDF Design → ui-ux branch → CSS → PR → main

=====================================

Phase 2 - Abhay (Frontend):
- Update HTML with ARIA labels
- Add responsive CSS breakpoints
- Increase font sizes
- Test on mobile devices

Phase 3 - Keshav (UI-UX):
- Implement PDF design

- Add animations
- Improve accessibility

Phase 4 - Keshav (Backend):
- Add localStorage
- Implement sorting
- Add confirmations
- Enhance validation

Phase 5 - Testing (Both):

- Feature testing
- Bug fixes

=====================================
7. Commit Message Convention
=====================================

Format: <type>: <description>

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- style: CSS/design changes
- docs: Documentation
- refactor: Code restructure
- test: Testing

Examples:
✅ feat: add localStorage for task persistence
✅ fix: resolve mobile layout overflow issue
✅ style: increase font sizes for readability
✅ docs: update README with setup instructions

=====================================
8. Branch Protection Rules
=====================================

Main Branch:
- Require PR before merge
- Require 1 approval
- No direct commits
- No force push

Working Branches (frontend, ui-ux, backend):

=====================================
9. Pull Request Workflow
=====================================

1. Make changes in your branch
2. Commit with proper message
3. Push to remote
4. Create PR on GitHub
5. Request review from team member
6. Address review comments
7. Get approval
8. Merge to main
9. Update your branch with main

=====================================
10. Technologies Used
=====================================

Frontend:
- HTML5 (semantic tags, ARIA)
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, animations)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

Backend:
